## Shutdown

* The raspberry pi should be shutdown using the **shutdown** button on the touchscreen. 
* The Norprene tubing should be removed from the vat of fly food, then any food remaining in the tubing can be expelled by pressing and holding the **prime** button on the peristaltic pump. Ensure there is a receptacle under the nozzle to catch the expelled fly food. The Norprene tubing should be removed from the robot for cleaning/sterilization. 
* All devices (raspberry pi, power supply unit for gShield and motors, and peristaltic pump) should be switched off.
* The robot can be wiped clean if necessary using a damp cloth. The platform can be removed for thorough cleaning.
